# Intel Gaudi Tutorials

These are the source files for the tutorials on https://developer.habana.ai/.

The tutorials provide step-by-step instructions for PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning on the Intel Gaudi AI Processor, from beginner level to advanced users.

## IMPORTANT: To run these Jupyter Notebooks you will need to follow these steps:
1. Get access to an Intel Gaudi 2 Accelerator card or node.  See the [Get Access](https://developer.habana.ai/get-access/) page on the Developer Website.  Be sure to use port forwarding `ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 -L 7860:localhost:7860 -L 6006:localhost:6006 ... user@ipaddress` to be able to access the notebook, run the Gradio interface, and use Tensorboard.   Some of the tutorials use all of these features.
2. Run the Intel Gaudi PyTorch Docker image.  Refer to the Docker section of the [Installation Guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Bare_Metal_Fresh_OS.html#bare-metal-fresh-os-single-click) for more information.  Running the docker image will allow you access to the entire software stack without having to worry about detailed Software installation Steps.
```
docker run -itd --name Gaudi_Docker --runtime=habana -e HABANA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all -e OMPI_MCA_btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism=none --cap-add=sys_nice --net=host --ipc=host vault.habana.ai/gaudi-docker/1.16.2/ubuntu22.04/habanalabs/pytorch-installer-2.2.2
docker exec -it Gaudi_Docker bash
```
3. Clone this tutorial in your $HOME directory:  `cd ~ && git clone https://www.github.com/habanaai/Gaudi-tutorials`
4. Install Jupyterlab: `python3 -m pip install jupyterlab`
5. Run the Jupyterlab Server, using the same port mapping as the ssh command:  `python3 -m jupyterlab_server --IdentityProvider.token='' --ServerApp.password='' --allow-root --port 8888 --ServerApp.root_dir=$HOME & ` and take the local URL and run that in your browser
