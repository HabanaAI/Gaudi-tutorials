    "Often NLP datasets have large variations in their samples length. setting a maximum sequence length (max_seq_len) and pad shorter sequences with zeros is a common approach used with GPUs and CPUs.This approach is very inefficient as it results in many unrequired operations (multiply by zeros). The potential speed up by avoiding padding is the ratio of max_seq_len over average sequence length (avg_seq_len) in the NLP dataset. For MLPerf's BERT dataset the potential speedup is roughly 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Habana's V1.1 MLPerf submission, we used a data packing technique [1], called Shortest-pack-first histogram-packing (SPFHP). Here instead of padding with zero, we pack several short sequences to one multi-sequence of size max_seq_len. Thus, we remove most of the padding, which can lead to up to x2 speedup in MLPerf BERT benchmark time-to-train (TTT). This packing technique can be applied on other types of datasets with high variability in samples length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that for each dataset with sequential data samples, the specific speedup with data packing is determined by the ratio of max_seq_len to average_seq_len in that particular NLP dataset. The larger the ratio, the higher the speedup. "

    "rows in the position embedding matrix according to **positions** field.\n",
    "<a id=’attention_mask’></a> \n",
    "#### (2) Attention mask: <br>\n",
    "Before packing, an attention mask was used by attention layers to filter out all paddings. For example, if we had a sample with an effective length of\n",
    "`n <= 512`, in **input_ids** field we would have `n` token ids padded by zeros till `512`. In this case, the attention mask would\n",
