    "# Model Migration from GPU to the Intel&reg; Gaudi&reg; 2 AI Accelerator \n",
    "\n",
    "The GPU Migration toolkit simplifies migrating PyTorch models that run on GPU-based architecture to run on the Intel® Gaudi® AI accelerator. Rather than manually replacing Python API calls that have dependencies on GPU libraries with Gaudi-specific API calls, the toolkit automates this process so you can run your model with fewer modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The GPU Migration toolkit maps specific API calls from the Python libraries and modules listed below to the appropriate equivalents in the Intel Gaudi software:\n",
    "\n",
    "* torch.cuda  \n",
    "* Torch API with GPU related parameters. For example, torch.randn(device=”cuda”)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The toolkit does not optimize the performance of the model, so further modifications may be required. For more details, refer to Model Performance Optimization Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will demonstrate how to use the GPU Migration toolset on a ResNet50 model which is based on open source implementation of ResNet50.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [GPU Migration Toolkit](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/PyTorch_Model_Porting/GPU_Migration_Toolkit/GPU_Migration_Toolkit.html) for more information.  \n",
    "\n",

    "### Enabling the GPU Migration Toolkit Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set the library\n",
    "Import the habana_frameworks.torch.gpu_migration package at the beginning of the primary Python script (main.py, train.py, etc.):\n",
    "`import habana_frameworks.torch.gpu_migration`\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use PT_HPU_GPU_MIGRATION=1 environment variable when running the primary Python script (main.py, train.py, etc.): `PT_HPU_GPU_MIGRATION=1 $PYTHON main.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set the Mark Step\n",
    "Add mark_step(). In Lazy mode, mark_step() must be added in all training scripts right after loss.backward() and optimizer.step().\n",
    "\n",
    "`htcore.mark_step()`   Note that if your model is using torch.compile, this step is not needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running Migrated code and logging changes \n",
    "Make sure that any device selection argument passed to the script is configured as if the script is running on a GPU. For example, add --cuda or --device gpu in the runtime command of your model. This will guarantee that the GPU Migration toolkit accurately detects and migrates instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can enable the logging feature, included in the GPU Migration toolkit, by setting the `GPU_MIGRATION_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable like this example:   \n",
    "`GPU_MIGRATION_LOG_LEVEL=3 PT_HPU_GPU_MIGRATION=1 $PYTHON main.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For More Information\n",
    "For more information regarding the use and configuration of the GPU Migration Toolkit and its limitations, please refer to the documentation here (https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/PyTorch_Model_Porting/GPU_Migration_Toolkit/GPU_Migration_Toolkit.htm)."
