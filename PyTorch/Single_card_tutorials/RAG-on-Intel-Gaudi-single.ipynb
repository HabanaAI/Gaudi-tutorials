    "A scalable Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application using huggingface tools as an way of deploying optimized applications utilizing the Intel Gaudi 2 accelerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial will show how to build a RAG application using Intel Gaudi 2. The Application will be built from easily accessible huggingface tools such as: text-generation-inference (TGI) and text-embeddings-inference (TEI). To make the code easier to understand, Langchain will be used.  The User interface at the end of the tutorial will use Gradio to submit your queries. This application will be in a docker environment, but can be easily deployed to a kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a method that enhances the precision and dependability of generative AI models by incorporating facts from external sources. This technique addresses the limitations of large language models (LLMs), which, despite their ability to generate responses to general prompts rapidly, may not provide in-depth or specific information. By enabling access to external knowledge sources, RAG improves factual consistency, increases the reliability of generated responses, and helps to mitigate the issue of \"hallucination\" in more complex and knowledge-intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Tutorial will show the steps of building the full RAG pipeline on Intel Gaudi 2.  To first ingest a text file and run an embedding model to create a vector store index and database.  Then to start to run a query, it will run the embedding model again on the query, match it with the contents of the database and send the overall prompt and query response to the Falcon 7B Large Language model to generate a full formed response. \n",

    "## 3. Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "To have a good quality RAG application, we need to prepare data. The data processing stage for vector database will extract text information from documents (for example PDFs, CSVs) then split it into chunks not exceeding max length, with additional metadata (for example filename or file creation date). Then it will upload preprocessed data to the vector database. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the process of data preprocessing, text splitting plays a crucial role. It involves breaking down the text into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks for further processing and analysis. Here are some common methods of text splitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **By Character**: This method involves splitting the text into individual characters. It's a straightforward approach, but it may not always be the most effective, as it doesn't take into account the semantic meaning of words or phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive**: Recursive splitting involves breaking down the text into smaller parts repeatedly until a certain condition is met. This method is particularly useful when dealing with complex structures in the text, as it allows for a more granular level of splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTML Specific**: When dealing with HTML content, text splitting can be done based on specific HTML tags or elements. This method is useful for extracting meaningful information from web pages or other HTML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Specific**: In the context of programming code, text can be split based on specific code syntax or structures. This method is particularly useful for code analysis or for building tools that work with code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **By Tokens**: Tokenization is a common method of text splitting in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It involves breaking down the text into individual words or tokens. This method is effective for understanding the semantic meaning of the text, as it allows for the analysis of individual words and their context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the choice of text splitting method depends largely on the nature of the text and the specific requirements of the task at hand. It's important to choose a method that effectively captures the semantic meaning of the text and facilitates further processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use the **Recursive** method. For better understanding of the topic you can check the https://langchain-text-splitter.streamlit.app/ app."
