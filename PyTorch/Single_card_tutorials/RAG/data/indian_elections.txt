2024 Indian general election

General elections were held in India from 19 April to 1 June 2024 in seven phases, to elect all 543 members of the Lok Sabha.[b] Votes were counted and the result was declared on 4 June to form the 18th Lok Sabha.[2][3] The legislative assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, and Sikkim were held simultaneously with the general election, along with the by-elections for 25 constituencies in 12 legislative assemblies.

More than 968 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion people were eligible to vote, equivalent to 70 percent of the total population.[4][5][6] 642 million voters participated in the election and 312 million of them were women, making it the highest ever participation by women voters.[7][8] This was the largest-ever election in history, surpassing the previous election, and lasted 44 days, second only to the 1951–52 Indian general election.

Incumbent prime minister Narendra Modi, who completed a second term, ran for a third consecutive term after his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had enjoyed an absolute majority—a minimum of 272 seats—in the 2019 and 2014 elections. The primary opposition was the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition formed by the Indian National Congress (INC) and many regional parties in 2023. The election was criticised for lack of action on hate speeches by Modi's BJP,[9] reported Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) malfunctioning,[10][11] and alleged suppression of political opponents of the BJP.[12]

Opinion surveys of mainstream media outlets projected a decisive victory for the BJP and its coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). However, the BJP won 240 seats, down from the 303 seats it had secured in 2019, and lost its singular majority in the Lok Sabha, whereas the overall NDA secured 293 of the house's 543 seats.[13] The INDIA coalition outperformed expectations, securing 234 seats, 99 of which were won by the Congress, garnering the party the Official Opposition status for the first time in 10 years.[14][15][16] By 5 June, Modi confirmed the support of 303 MPs, including three MPs from minor parties and ten other independent MPs, to Droupadi Murmu, the 15th President of India. This marked Modi's third term as Prime Minister and his first time heading a coalition government, with the Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh and Janata Dal (United) of Bihar emerging as two main allies, whose confidence is crucial for the government's term.[17][18][19]

Background
Contemporary politics and previous elections
India has a multi-party system with two major parties, namely the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Indian National Congress, that dominate politics at the national level. The BJP has governed the country with Narendra Modi at the helm since 2014. The tenure of the 17th Lok Sabha is scheduled to end on 16 June 2024.[20] The previous general election was held in April–May 2019, after which the National Democratic Alliance, led by the BJP, formed the union government, with Modi continuing as Prime Minister.[21] The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, comprising of 26 opposition parties, was formed in 2023 to contest the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.[22]

Electoral system
Article 83 of the Constitution of India requires elections to the Lok Sabha to be held once every five years.[23] All 543 elected MPs are elected from single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting.[24] The 104th amendment to the constitution abolished the two seats that were reserved for the Anglo-Indian community.[25]

Eligible voters must be Indian citizens, 18 years or older, ordinary residents of the polling area of the constituency and registered to vote (name included in the electoral rolls), possess a valid voter identification card issued by the Election Commission of India or equivalent.[26] Some people convicted of electoral or other offenses are barred from voting.[27] Indians holding foreign citizenship are also barred from voting. There is no postal or online absentee voting in India; members of the Indian diaspora are required to travel back to their home constituencies in order to cast a ballot.[28]

For the 2024 election, 968 million people are eligible to vote, an increase of about 150 million people from the 2019 election.[29] In Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station will be set up for the only registered voter in the village of Malogam, due to electoral laws that stipulate voting booths to be placed within two kilometres (1.2 mi) from all settlements.[30][31][32] A polling station was also set up inside the Gir Forest in Gujarat to cater for a singular voter, a priest at a Hindu temple.[33] Polling stations will also be set up inside a wildlife sanctuary in Kerala and in a shipping container in Gujarat,[34] as well as in 320 relief camps hosting some 59,000 people displaced during interethnic violence in Manipur.[35]

In March 2024, the Supreme Court of India rejected a petition by the Congress Party to end the usage of electronic voting machines and revert to paper ballots and manual counting, which was the system used in elections until the late 1990s, with the party citing risks of electoral fraud.[36] Nearly 5.5 million electronic voting machines were to be utilized for more than one million polling stations, while 15 million election workers and security personnel were to be tasked with managing the conduct of the election.[32]

For the first time, the Election Commission of India allowed voters with disabilities and those over the age of 85 to cast ballots from their homes due to concerns over high temperatures. In Telangana, voting in some precincts was extended by a later hour to allow voters to come at a more convenient time.[37]

Planning

Key processes during a Lok Sabha election involve monitoring campaign expenditure, preventing the circulation of illicit goods, and ensuring adherence to the Model Code of Conduct. In the final 48 hours before voting, campaigns are ended, and measures are implemented to maintain order and prevent disruptions. On polling day, strict rules are enforced to prevent undue influence, ensuring a smooth and secure election process. Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are sealed and stored with tight security measures, while Booth Level Officers assist voters throughout the process.[38]
