    "### Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning with Low Rank Adaptation\n",
    "Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning is a strategy for adapting large pre-trained language models to specific tasks while minimizing computational and memory demands.   It aims to reduce the computational cost and memory requirements associated with fine-tuning large models while maintaining or even improving their performance.  It does so by adding a smaller task-specific layer, leveraging knowledge distillation, and often relying on few-shot learning, resulting in efficient yet effective models for various natural language understanding tasks.   PEFT starts with a pre-trained language model that has already learned a wide range of language understanding tasks from a large corpus of text data. These models are usually large and computationally expensive.   Instead of fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model, PEFT adds a task-specific layer or a few task-specific layers on top of the pre-trained model. These additional layers are relatively smaller and have fewer parameters compared to the base model.\n"
