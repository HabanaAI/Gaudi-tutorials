    "## Overview\n",
    "Mixed precision is the use of both 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point types in a model during training to make it faster and use less memory. By keeping certain parts of the model in the 32-bit types for numerical stability, the model will have a lower step time and train equally as well in terms of the evaluation metrics such as accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models that use float32 will take 32 bits of memory. However, there are two lower-precision dtypes, float16 and bfloat16. Each of them takes 16 bits of memory instead. Modern accelerators can run operations faster in the 16-bit dtypes, as they have specialized hardware to run 16-bit computations and 16-bit dtypes can be read from memory faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Habana HPUs can run operations in bfloat16 faster than float32. Therefore, these lower-precision dtypes should be used whenever possible on HPUs. However, variables and a few computations should still be in float32 for numerical stability so that the model is trained to the same quality. The PyTorch mixed precision allows you to use a mix of bfloat16 and float32 during model training, to get the performance benefits from bfloat16 and the numerical stability benefits from float32.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In this tutorial, the term \"numerical stability\" refers to how a model's quality is affected by the use of a lower-precision dtype instead of a higher precision dtype. An operation is \"numerically unstable\" in bfloat16 if running it in bfloat16 dtypes causes the model to have worse evaluation accuracy or other metrics compared to running the operation in float32."
