    "\n",
    "The GPU Migration toolkit simplifies migrating PyTorch models that run on GPU-based architecture to run on the Intel® Gaudi® AI accelerator. Rather than manually replacing Python API calls that have dependencies on GPU libraries with Gaudi-specific API calls, the toolkit automates this process so you can run your model with fewer modifications.  \n",
