    "Using the Text Generation for Inference (TGI-gaudi) from Hugging Face to easily setup an LLM chatbot or text generation service\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial will show how to setup and run the TGI-gaudi framework.  TGI-gaudi is a powerful framework designed for deploying and serving large-scale language models efficiently. TGI enables seamless interaction with state-of-the-art models, making it easier for developers to integrate advanced natural language processing capabilities into their applications. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of TGI-gaudi, demonstrating how to set up and use it to generate text responses based on user inputs. We will cover essential concepts, provide code examples, and show you how to customize and control the behavior of your text generation models using TGI. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of TGI and how to harness its potential for various text generation tasks.  This includes an example using Llama 3 8B Instucts model with the default values as well as an Optimized Llama 2 13B model optimized to suppport the maximum concurrent users in a reasonable time.\n"

It's important to undersand what these do and should be tuned for best performance.  For the full descsiption of Environment Variables please see the TGI-Gaudi [README](https://github.com/huggingface/tgi-gaudi?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-variables) and for the model configuration variables, you can review the TGI [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/basic_tutorials/launcher)  \n",

    "**--max-total-tokens** \n",
    "This is the most important value to set as it defines the \"memory budget\" of running clients requests. Clients will send input sequences and ask to generate `max_new_tokens` on top. With a value of `1512` users can send either a prompt of `1000` and ask for `512` new tokens, or send a prompt of `1` and ask for `1511` max_new_tokens.  The example above sets the total tokens at 2048\n",

    "**--max-input-tokens** \n",
    "This is the maximum allowed input length (expressed in number of tokens) for users. The larger this value, the longer prompt users can send which can impact the overall memory required to handle the load. Please note that some models have a finite range of sequence they can handle. Default to min(max_position_embeddings - 1, 4095).  For this example, \n",

    "**--max-batch-prefill-tokens** \n",

    "\n",
    "**--max-batch-total-tokens**\n",
    "This is one critical control to allow maximum usage of the available hardware.  This represents the total amount of potential tokens within a batch. When using padding (not recommended) this would be equivalent of `batch_size` * `max_total_tokens`.  Overall this number should be the largest possible amount that fits the remaining memory (after the model is loaded). Since the actual memory overhead depends on other parameters like if you're using quantization, flash attention or the model implementation, text-generation-inference cannot infer this number automatically.\n",
