    "This tutorial will show the user how to run the Intel Gaudi Profiling tools: the habana_perf_tool and the Tensorboard plug-in on the Intel Gaudi 2 AI Accelerator, and the profiling trace viewer.  These tools will provide the user valueable optimization tips and information to modify any model for better performance.   Following these steps and using these tools can help you better understand some of the bottlenecks of your model.  For more information, please refer to the [Profiling](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Profiling/index.html) section of the documentation for info on how to setup the profiler and the [Optimization Guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/Model_Optimization_PyTorch/index.html) for additional background on other optimization techniques.\n",

    "We start with an Intel Gaudi PyTorch Docker image and run this notebook.   For this example, we'll be using the [Swin Transformer](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/swin-base-patch4-window7-224-in22k) model from the Hugging Face Repository running on Hugging Face's Optimum-Habana library.
