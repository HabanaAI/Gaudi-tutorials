    "# Inference on the Intel&reg; Gaudi&reg; 2 AI Accelerator\n",
    "This example will show how to run model inference on the Llama 2 70B model using the Hugging Face Optimum Habana library.   The Optimum Habana library is optimized for Deep Learning inference on tasks such as text generation, language modeling, question answering and more; these contain fully optimized and fully documented model examples and should be used as a starting point for model execution.  For all the examples and models, please refer to the [Optimum Habana GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana#validated-models).  \n",
